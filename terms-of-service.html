        <h3>Fees</h3>
        <p>
            A valid payment method, including a credit card or PayPal, is required for paying accounts. If neither of these is present on the account, the account may be closed.

Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle. You hereby agree to keep such valid credit card and/or bank account in effect with sufficient credit limit to enable Metricks to charge the Subscription Fees every month, quarter or another period of each Term, as applicable, and not to challenge such charges or to request reversal of such charges. 
        </p>

        <h3>Taxes</h3>
        <p>
            All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties.

        <p>
            Downgrading your Service may cause the loss of content, features, or capacity of your Account. Metricks does not accept any liability for such loss.
        </p>
        

        <p>
            Downgrading your Service to a non-white label level will cause all Affiliates who registered while the white label Service was activated, to be deactivated
        </p>
        

        <p>
            Every Service level has its own number of tracking events (“Tracking Events”). Whenever the number of Tracking Events, as agreed upon and limited in the relevant Service level, is exceeded during the Subscription Period, we will calculate the price for the surplus Tracking Events in accordance with the overage fees listed on the pricing page as part of Service level. In such a case, the extra costs of the surplus Tracking Events will be added to the relevant monthly fee.
        </p>

        <h3>Cancellation and Termination </h3>
        <p>
            We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.
